/* Update the existing CSS with the swiper container fix */

@import "tailwindcss";

/* 1. Fix for Individual Slides */
.custom-swiper-slide {
    /* Ensures content scales out of the slide box */
    overflow: visible !important; 
    /* Necessary so the hovered card appears on top of adjacent slides */
    z-index: 1; 
}

/* 2. Fix for Swiper Wrapper (the track holding all slides) */
.swiper-wrapper {
    /* Ensures the track doesn't clip the content */
    overflow: visible !important;
}

/* 3. ⭐ CRITICAL FIX: Target the main Swiper container */
.swiper {
    /* This is often the element that has overflow: hidden applied by the library */
    overflow: visible !important;
}
